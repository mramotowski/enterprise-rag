# Intel® AI for Enterprise RAG Documentation

The technical documentation for the RAG application layer. Start with **Meet** for the
what and why, **Get started** to stand it up, **Deploy** to choose a pipeline and go
further, then customize, operate, and look things up as needed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This layer is a component of [Intel® AI for Enterprise Solutions](https://github.com/intel/enterprise-ai-solutions). Clone **that** repository, run every command from its root, and `init erag` will fetch this one into `ext/` for you. See [Meet](meet/meet.md#where-the-pieces-live).
